## Hi Explorer, I am Ahmed ðŸŽ§

I am currently pursuing my master of engineering in artificial intelligence at Duke University and am passionate about AI research and Music Technology

Current Research
1. Developing imperceptible perturbations in music to protect artists and prevent AI mimicry
2. Developing Classwise, a Duke platform used by Duke professors and students as a companion for learning and tracking progress through AI-generated quizzes, evaluation, and feedback. The user interactions are used for research to gather more insights on the use of AI in enhancing learning outcomes.
